# Facial Recognition of Identical Twins using Convolutional Neural Networks
(in progress)

Facial recognition has come a long way in the last few years, thanks to convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The question is, can neural nets tell identical twins apart? I have an identical twin brother, and on a number of occasions Iâ€™ve been able to unlock his iPhone with my face. Thus, facial recognition of similar-looking faces, while excellent, is still an important security issue that needs to be addressed.

Beginning with the VGG-Face pretrained model and using transfer learning, a CNN is being trained to distinguish between me and my identical twin brother.
