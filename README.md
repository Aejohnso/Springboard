# Springboard

This repository houses all code, data, and files related to my work in the Springboard Data Science Career Track bootcamp. The following acts as a table of contents for the whole repository with links to the respective works. Expected completion date: May 20, 2019.

## [Capstone #1](https://github.com/Aejohnso/Springboard/tree/master/Capstone%201%20Project): Predicting Airbnb User Bookings with Supervised Machine Learning
Airbnb user data was collected, cleaned, explored, and ultimately used to train a random forest classifier to predict if a user will make a booking or not. This predictive model may be useful to Airbnb in order to pick out which users need a little extra incentive to get them to make their first booking. The final metric of interest, the ROC AUC, was 0.76.

## [Capstone #2](https://github.com/Aejohnso/Springboard/tree/master/Capstone%202%20Project): Facial Recognition with Deep Learning (in progress)
Beginning with the VGG-Face pretrained model and using transfer learning, a convolutional neural network is being trained to distinguish between me and my identical twin brother.
